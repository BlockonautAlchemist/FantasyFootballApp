Refactor my React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind app to adopt a minimalist, high-impact portfolio style inspired by modern personal sites with smooth animations.

Design language

Typography-first, lots of white space, big headings.

Fonts: load Inter (body) and Space Grotesk (display) via CSS import.

Colors: near-white background #0b0b0b text on #f6f6f6 (or dark mode inverse), subtle accents only.

Grid: wide container (max-w-6xl) with generous paddings.

Libraries

Add framer-motion for component/scroll reveals.

Add lenis (or equivalent) for smooth scrolling inertia.

No backend.

Global

Create src/styles/theme.css with base styles: selection color, link underline animation, oversized H1/H2 scales, .container utility.

In main.tsx, initialize Lenis smooth scroll.

Layout

Sticky top bar with minimal logo on left and nav on right (underline-on-hover).

Footer with tiny mono text and social links.

Hero section (home)

Full-viewport hero with oversized headline (2–3 lines), subcopy, and a subtle parallax background block.

“Explore” chevron that smooth-scrolls to the next section.

Section patterns

Marquee/intro line: slow, continuous marquee text (CSS transform loop).

Cards row for your tools (Start/Sit, Waivers, Trade, etc.) with magnetic hover (scale 1.02) and motion fade-up on enter.

Feature split: image/illustration placeholder on one side, copy on the other; parallax translateY on scroll.

Quote/CTA band with subtle grain/noise background.

Animations (Framer Motion)

Reusable variants: fadeUp, stagger, scaleIn, parallax.

Animate on view with once: true, small delays, spring transitions.

Page transitions: fade/slide between routes.

Chatbot page

Minimal chat panel with floating input; messages fade/slide in.

Header has big “Ask the Assistant” title with reveal.

Utilities/components

Reveal.tsx (wraps children with motion + viewport)

Marquee.tsx (CSS keyframes)

Parallax.tsx (ties scroll to transform)

MagneticButton.tsx (scale + slight translate on hover)

Update existing cards to use these effects.

Acceptance

Smooth scroll feels inertial.

Sections reveal as they enter viewport; hero has parallax.

Cards subtly scale on hover; links underline animate.

No blocking network calls; all current pages still route and render.

Provide a README note on where to plug real data later.

Implement this styling and motion system across the Home/Dashboard and reuse on other pages for a cohesive, animated experience.
